# In a nutshell

Dromedary is a command line application that uses a plain JSON manifest -Dromedary File- where API routes are defined, as well as the flow of actions to be executed for each of them.

It relies in an <b>extreme modular architecture</b>, where every action is a <b>configurable plugin available through NPM.</b>
