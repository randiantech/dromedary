# Dromedary Framework

!Note: Dromedary is in experimental state, and by no means its ready for production use. We'll let you know once Dromedary is ready to go!

<b>Dromedary provides a lightweight, configuration driven solution to enable limitless integrations in an API centric world.</b>


# In a nutshell

Dromedary is a command line application that uses a plain JSON manifest -Dromedary File- where API routes are defined, as well as the flow of actions to be executed for each of them.

It relies in an <b>extreme modular architecture</b>, where every action is a <b>configurable plugin available through NPM.</b>
