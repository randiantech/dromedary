# Dromedary Framework

!Note: Dromedary is in experimental state, and by no means its ready for production use. We'll let you know once Dromedary is ready to go!

Dromedary is a lightweight, configuration driven platform that enable limitless integrations in an API centric world.
Thanks to its extremely modular architecture


# In a nutshell

Dromedary is a command line application that uses a plain JSON manifest -Dromedary File- where API routes are defined, as well as the flow of actions to be executed for each of them.

It relies in an extreme modular architecture, where every action is a configurable plugin available through NPM.
